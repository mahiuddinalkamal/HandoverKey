## 🎯 What is HandoverKey?

HandoverKey is a zero-knowledge, end-to-end encrypted digital legacy platform that ensures your digital assets are securely passed to your trusted contacts if something happens to you. Think of it as a "dead man's switch" for your digital life.

### Key Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**: Your data is encrypted client-side before it ever reaches our servers
- **Dead Man's Switch**: Automatic handover after configurable inactivity period (default: 90 days)
- **Multi-Party Handover**: Require multiple trusted contacts to confirm before release
- **Cross-Platform**: Web, mobile apps, and CLI tools
- **Hardware Key Support**: YubiKey, FIDO2, and other security keys
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transparency of all access attempts and system events
- **Open Source**: Full transparency - inspect, verify, and contribute

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Encryption Model

1. **Client-Side Encryption**: All data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM before upload
2. **Key Derivation**: Master key derived from user password using PBKDF2
3. **Secret Sharing**: Shamir's Secret Sharing for multi-party handover
4. **Zero-Knowledge**: Server never sees plaintext data

### Security Features

- End-to-end encryption (E2EE)
- Hardware security key support
- Multi-factor authentication
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security audits
- Open source for transparency
